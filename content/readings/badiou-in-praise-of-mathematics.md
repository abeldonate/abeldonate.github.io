# Introduction

Philosophy born in Greece because mathematics, art, politics and emotions. (4 types : science, art, politics and love)

# Mathematics must be saved

mathematics requires toy to become a Subject whose freedom, far from being opposed to discipline, demands it.

Lacan: "desire and low are not opposites, but dilectically identical"

Sartre the one who revealed philosophy to Badiou, but not compatible with mathematics: "Science is zilch; morality's an asshole" (La ciencia es la nada; la moralidad es idiota)

Majority of mathematicians elitist relationship with the discipline

There is a need for philosophy. Should be taught a lot sooner.

**Analytic Philosophy** longuistic distiction between statments that make sense, and non sense.
**Cognitivism**: reduce all questions to the brain mechanisms

So the divergence between mathematics and philosophy also stems from the fact that philosophy, owing to the shallow, reactionary figure of “the new philosopher,” has undergone an incredible trivialization of its status.

# Philosophy and Mathematics, or the Story of an Old Couple

Mathmatics is parto of democratic thought, which moreover appeared in Greece at the same time. Close link between mathematics, democracy and philosophy.

Spinoza: "If mathematics hadn't existed, man would have remained in ignorance, in particular because he would have continued to explain everithing by final causes, mythologies of supernatural powers"

Three types of knowledge Spinoza:

- Sensory and imaginative representation (ordinary ignorance)
- methodical conceptual knowledge (mathematical proofs)
- intuitive knowledge of God, philosophical knowledge

Kant: "mathematics is necessary in order for philosophy to exists"

**realist (platonic) vs formalist conception**
Kant is "a prioric" conception
