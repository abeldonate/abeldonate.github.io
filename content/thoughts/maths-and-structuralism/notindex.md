There exists plenty of interpretations of what is in heart of mathematics. The most important ones in terms of influence and discourse are the following:

- Formalism
- Logicism
- Platonism
- Intuitionism
- Structuralism

In this post we will deep dive in the last one: Structuralism.

First of all we warn the vast number of currents inside the general one. In this post we will only focus on the main idea, leaving aside the difference in them. For a further classification we strongly recommend this reading[^stanford]

## Brief introduction

Historically the founder of this current is considered to be David Hilbert, but the first building blocks of the philosophy were placed by Paul Benacerraf and Hilary Putnam at 1960s. The successors of this current in the 1980sâ€“90s were mainly Michael Resnik, Stuart Shapiro, Geoffrey Hellman and Charles Parsons. They introduced several variants of the scratched current.

The idea behind structuralism is to displace the focus from the **object** to **structure**. This means that the self object is not important anymore, now the importance lays in the **relations** on the objects.

The context of the development in the current is the context of formalization of mathematics via the axioms of set theory. Zermelo axioms described the set of the naturals recursively with the use of the alternative successor function $f:x\to x\cup \{x\}$. Benecraft, as structuralist, states that natural numbers (types of objects) should not be identified with theoretical objects, he even states that such objects do not exists. Instead, he thinks about the structure that lays underneath, the "natural number structure", and treat numbers merely as positions in this structure.
